# Movie Rental

This project has been created to demonstrate application of Software Engineering and Testing principles. 
- This repo uses the Movie Rental code, found in the first chapter of the 1<sup>st</sup> edition of [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html), as the base code, and demos the aforementioned principles on that.
- This book can also be downloaded for free from [this GitHub public repo](https://github.com/petyakostova/IT-Books/blob/master/Programming/Refactoring%20Improving%20the%20Design%20of%20Existing%20Code%20-%20Martin%20Fowler%2C%20Kent%20Beck%2C%20John%20Brant%2C%20William%20Opdyke%2C%20Don%20Roberts.pdf)*.
- I came across this code while I was enrolled in [Dr. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/%7Etien.n.nguyen/index.html)'s [CS6359 - Object Oriented Analysis and Design](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/search/now/cs6359) at [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://cs.utdallas.edu) in Spring 2020, while pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science.
- I have incorporated Apache Maven in this project.
- I will try to write as much tests as possible.
- I have incorporated [Codacy](https://github.com/marketplace/codacy) for code quality check.
